This app is the compliment of the Bowdoin Dining Chrome extension [(code available here)](https://github.com/rmartinez93/bowdoindining-chrome), and is intended to replace the outdated version currently on the iOS App Store. It includes all the features of the original in a cleaner, more modern design aesthetic, and adds some new ones like access to personal account information. I plan to release this app for iOS 8 in September.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
