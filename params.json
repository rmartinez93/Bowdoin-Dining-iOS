This app is the compliment of the Bowdoin Dining Chrome extension [(code available here)](https://github.com/rmartinez93/bowdoindining-chrome), and is intended to replace the outdated version currently on the iOS App Store. It includes all the features of the original in a cleaner, more modern design aesthetic, and adds some new ones like access to personal account information, filtering by diet, and more. I plan to release this app in late September.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmartinez93/Bowdoin-Dining-iOS/master/Screenshots/1.PNG)\r\n![Screenshot 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmartinez93/Bowdoin-Dining-iOS/master/Screenshots/2.JPG)\r\n![Screenshot 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmartinez93/Bowdoin-Dining-iOS/master/Screenshots/3.JPG)\r\n![Screenshot 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmartinez93/Bowdoin-Dining-iOS/master/Screenshots/4.JPG)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
