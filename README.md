Bowdoin Dining for iOS
==================

A Bowdoin Dining app for the next generation of Bow-diners. This app is the compliment of the Bowdoin Dining Chrome extension [(code available here)](https://github.com/rmartinez93/bowdoindining-chrome), and is intended to replace the outdated version currently on the iOS App Store. It includes all the features of the original in a cleaner, more modern design aesthetic, and adds some new ones like access to personal account information, filtering by diet, and more. I plan to release this app in late September.
